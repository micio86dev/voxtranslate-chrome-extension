# Discovery — VoxTranslate for Chrome

Phase 1 output. Everything below was read out of the workspace on 2026-08-01; nothing is assumed.
File references are `path:line` against the parent repo unless stated otherwise.

## 1. Workspace and repositories

| Repo                             | Path         | Remote                                                 | Branch    |
| -------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| Parent (server + client + infra) | `.`          | `git@github.com:micio86dev/voxtranslate.git`           | `develop` |
| Website (marketing)              | `website/`   | `git@github.com:micio86dev/voxtranslate-website.git`   | `main`    |
| Dashboard (B2B)                  | `dashboard/` | `git@github.com:micio86dev/voxtranslate-dashboard.git` | `main`    |
| n8n workflows                    | `n8n/`       | `git@github.com:micio86dev/voxtranslate-n8n.git`       | `main`    |

Submodules are declared in `.gitmodules` and pinned; `git submodule status` is clean.

**Naming convention is established**: every submodule is `voxtranslate-<thing>` under the `micio86dev`
personal account (not an org). So `voxtranslate-chrome-extension` is the correct name.

Verified with `gh`:

- Authenticated as `micio86dev`, token scopes `admin:public_key, gist, read:org, repo` → repo creation is possible.
- `micio86dev/voxtranslate-chrome-extension` **does not exist**. Nothing to overwrite.

Tooling present: `bun 1.3.0`, `node v24.18.0`, `rustc 1.89.0`.

### 1.1 Build verification constraint (blocking, verified)

`cargo check` in `server/` **fails to build at all** on this machine:

```
error: rustc 1.89.0 is not supported by the following packages:
  typst@0.15.1 requires rustc 1.92   (+ krilla, hayro, 20 more — the PDF stack)
```

**Consequence: no backend Rust change can be compiled or tested locally.** Any server-side work
in this project is verifiable only through GitHub CI. This is the single biggest constraint on
scoping the backend half of this feature, and it is why the plan pushes to minimise backend churn.

The client is Astro 5 + vanilla TS under `client/src/{layouts,pages,scripts}`.

---

## 2. Authentication — what actually exists

`server/src/auth.rs`, routes in `server/src/lib.rs:566-592`.

- **Google-only.** `POST /api/auth/google` accepts either a legacy GSI `credential` (Google ID token)
  or an OAuth `code` + `redirect_uri` that the server exchanges with Google (`google_oauth.rs`).
- Verification: Google `tokeninfo`, then asserts `aud == our client id`, `iss` is Google, and
  `email_verified` (`auth.rs:91-106`).
- On success it upserts the user (granting `free_credits` on first login only) and returns:
  `{ token, user: UserProfile, calendar_connected, is_new }` (`auth.rs:341-354`).
- **Session token = one HS256 JWT** (`issue_jwt`, `auth.rs:147`) with claims `{sub, email, name, exp}`,
  lifetime `billing.jwt_expiry_hours`.
- `GET /api/auth/config` returns the public Google client id — also used by clients as the
  "is billing enabled?" probe.
- `GET /api/user/me` returns the profile + balance.

### What does NOT exist

This matters enormously for the task brief, which assumes an OAuth authorization server:

| Brief assumes                                    | Reality                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `GET /api/extension/authorize`                   | ✗ no authorization endpoint of our own                             |
| Authorization-code + PKCE issued by VoxTranslate | ✗ nothing issues our own auth codes                                |
| Refresh tokens, rotation                         | ✗ **no refresh token exists at all**                               |
| `POST /api/extension/logout` / revocation        | ✗ JWTs are stateless; there is no revocation list or session table |
| Short-lived access tokens                        | ✗ one long-lived JWT is the whole model                            |

VoxTranslate is an **OAuth client** (to Google). It is **not an OAuth authorization server**.
Building `/authorize` + PKCE + code exchange + refresh rotation + revocation means writing an AS
from scratch, including a new token/session table and migration — on a production service that I
cannot compile locally.

`chrome.identity.launchWebAuthFlow` itself is fine and is the right API; the question is only what
it talks to on our side.

---

## 3. Money model — the brief and the codebase disagree

This is the most consequential mismatch found.

### Consumer (B2C) — what the extension would use

`server/src/billing.rs`, tables `users`, `credit_transactions`, `usage_sessions`.

- Balance is `users.balance`, a **`Decimal` in USD**. Not credits. There is no currency column.
- `credit_transactions` rows are USD amounts with `kind ∈ {purchase, usage, free_credit, ai_*, …}`.
- Metering deducts USD directly: `amount = usd(rate_per_second × interval × streams)` (`usage.rs:137`).
- `UserProfile.balance` is serialized as a plain `f64` (`auth.rs:284`).
- **There is no consumer subscription plan.** No plan table, no `allowed_tiers`, no `default_tier`.
  The consumer product is pure pay-as-you-go against a USD balance.

### Organisation (B2B) — separate, do not touch

`server/src/business/credits.rs` — `organizations.credits_balance` is an **`INTEGER` credit pool**
with its own `organization_credits_transactions` ledger and real plans/subscriptions.
The module header states the rule explicitly:

> "Org credits and consumer DECIMAL credits never mix."

### So, concretely

The brief's account payload is not implementable as written:

| Brief field                 | Reality                                                                |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `credits.remaining: 1428.4` | consumer balance is USD dollars, e.g. `2.54`                           |
| `credits.currency: "EUR"`   | no currency concept; everything is USD                                 |
| `plan.code` / `plan.name`   | no consumer plan exists                                                |
| `plan.allowed_tiers`        | no per-plan tier gating exists — all engines are available to everyone |
| `plan.default_tier`         | not stored                                                             |
| `usage_counter.reset_at`    | does not exist (see §7)                                                |

Two honest options, to be decided in the plan: mirror the real USD model in the extension UI
(cheap, truthful, ships now), or invent a consumer credits/plans layer (large, touches billing,
needs migrations + Stripe rework). The brief's own rule — _"do not hard-code commercial rules
that already exist"_ and _"never create a second independent credit ledger"_ — points at the first.

---

## 4. Tiers are engines

`server/src/engine/mod.rs`, `engine/metadata.rs`, exposed by `GET /api/engines` (`api.rs:57`).

Four registered engines. **The persisted ids do not match the display names** — a frozen historical
quirk documented at `engine/mod.rs:40-57`:

| Display name | `tier` label | persisted `id`          | translated audio | client-direct |
| ------------ | ------------ | ----------------------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| Standard     | `standard`   | `standard`              | no (client TTS)  | no            |
| Enhanced     | `enhanced`   | `cartesia`              | yes (in browser) | **yes**       |
| Pro          | `pro`        | **`premium`**           | yes              | no            |
| Premium      | `premium`    | `gemini_live_translate` | yes              | no            |

`EngineInfo` (the client-safe DTO) carries `rate_per_minute = cost × (1 + markup)`.
Raw `cost_per_minute` and `markup` are **never serialized** — there is a test asserting it
(`metadata.rs:134`). The extension must display `rate_per_minute` and nothing else.

**Enhanced is architecturally special**: `capabilities.client_direct = true`. The browser connects
straight to Cartesia with a server-minted short-lived token (`POST /api/sessions/enhanced/session`);
the server never sees that audio and only bills the meter. Porting Enhanced to the extension means
porting a whole second client-side pipeline (Cartesia STT + TTS + a `translate_text` round-trip
through our WS for the translation hop, since Cartesia does not translate — `protocol.rs:106-115`).

### Languages

`server/src/engine/languages.json` — **84 languages**, the single source of truth, shared by the
Rust backend (`include_str!`) and the TS frontend (`client/src/scripts/langmap.ts`).
Keyed per tier: `standard`, `enhanced`, `pro`, `premium`. The extension should consume this same
file rather than duplicating a language list.

---

## 5. WebSocket protocol

`server/src/protocol.rs`, handler `lib.rs:992`.

**Connect:** `GET /ws?room=&lang=&name=&id=&public=&token=&engine=`

- `token` is the session JWT **in the query string** — the existing, established convention.
- `lang=auto` is explicitly allowed at join time (`lib.rs:1001-1014`); `set_lang` later rejects `auto`.
- No token → guest (unbilled). Invalid token → connection rejected.

**Client → server** (JSON text frames): `start`, `stop`, `offer`, `answer`, `ice`, `chat`,
`mute_audio`, `mute_video`, `emoji`, `hand_raise`, `screen_share`, `set_lang`, `whiteboard`, `game`,
`enhanced_fallback`, `translate_text`.

**Server → client**: `room_joined`, `peer_joined`, `peer_left`, `room_full`, signaling,
`chat_message`, `subtitle_interim`, `subtitle_final`, `translated_audio`, `language_detected`,
`balance_update`, `low_balance`, `balance_exhausted`, `engine_downgraded`, `capture_format`,
`translated_text`, `moderation_warning`, `error{message, code}`.

Notable, and directly reusable by the extension:

- `subtitle_interim { speaker_id, speaker_name, text, lang }` — partials.
- `subtitle_final { speaker_id, speaker_name, original, lang, translations: {lang → text} }` — finals
  fan out to **every** language in the room; the client picks `translations[my_lang]`.
- `translated_audio { speaker_id, lang, seq, pcm16_b64 }` — **PCM16 mono @ 24 kHz, base64, sequenced**.
  A translated-audio queue with ordering already has a wire format. No need to invent one.
- `language_detected { peer_id, lang, confidence? }`.
- `balance_update` / `low_balance` (once) / `balance_exhausted` — the usage/credit events already exist.
- `error.code` (e.g. `insufficient_balance`, `invalid_token`, `banned`) — structured errors exist.

**Audio is sent as binary frames.**

### Audio format (settled — do not choose a new codec)

- Default: **WebM/Opus, 32 kbps, mono, 100 ms `MediaRecorder` timeslice**
  (`client/src/scripts/audio-capture.ts:37-39`; spec 0043).
- Deepgram is opened with `container=webm` and lets the header carry rate/encoding (`deepgram.rs:80-84`),
  model `nova-2`.
- Alternative: **PCM16 / 24 kHz / mono**, used only when the server pushes `capture_format {pcm:true}`
  because a Pro/Premium listener needs the same stream to feed both OpenAI and Deepgram
  (`deepgram.rs:87`, `protocol.rs:348-356`).

The extension should emit WebM/Opus 32 kbps @ 100 ms and honour `capture_format`. That matches the
brief's "100–250 ms" target and requires zero backend codec work.

---

## 6. The core architectural blocker: rooms are symmetric, the extension is not

This is the finding that most shapes the plan.

`server/src/rooms.rs`, `usage.rs`.

VoxTranslate's model is a **room of symmetric peers**. Every peer has exactly **one `lang`** —
the language they speak _and_ receive in. There is no per-peer source/target split.

Translation fan-out is derived from _other_ peers:

- `get_room_languages(room, exclude_id)` returns distinct languages of **other** peers, skipping `"auto"`
  (`rooms.rs:610-620`).
- `billable_streams(targets, speaker_lang, …)` returns **`None`** when no target language differs from
  the speaker's (`usage.rs:69-82`) — the meter then _skips the tick entirely_.
- A listener whose language equals the speaker's is skipped from delivery (`rooms.rs:145-155`).

**Therefore a single-peer room transcribes nothing useful, translates nothing, and bills nothing.**

The extension's shape is fundamentally different:

```
room model:      peer(lang=it) ⇄ peer(lang=en)      symmetric, both speak
extension model: tab audio (lang=?, never listens) → user (lang=it, never speaks)
```

One foreign audio **source**, one **listener**, asymmetric, and the source's language is unknown
and may change mid-stream. This does not map onto a one-peer room.

**Two ways out** (decision belongs in the plan):

- **(a) Synthetic two-peer room.** The extension opens two WS connections into a private room:
  one "tab" peer with `lang=auto` that only sends audio, one "listener" peer with `lang=<target>`
  that only receives. Zero protocol change; but it doubles connections, abuses room semantics,
  pollutes room/peer metrics and the lobby, and makes the source==target bypass behave oddly
  (the tab peer resolving to the listener's language collapses the room to one language, which
  is _correct_ for bypass but arrives via a confusing path).
- **(b) A dedicated single-peer extension session.** A `client=chrome-extension` mode on the WS
  (or a sibling route) with an explicit `source`/`target` split and a new `MeterScope`. Cleaner
  semantics, isolated blast radius, but it is genuinely new backend code — in a repo I cannot
  compile locally.

### What already exists and should NOT be rebuilt

- **Source == target bypass**: already the server's behaviour. When the speaker's language matches
  the only listener language, delivery is skipped _and_ the meter skips the tick — i.e. **no charge**.
  The brief's "don't translate, don't bill when languages match" is existing behaviour, room-shaped.
- **Language detection**: Deepgram `detect_language=true`, surfaced as `language_detected` with a
  confidence. Stability/hysteresis on top of it is client work and does not exist yet.
- **Low/exhausted credit**: `low_balance` (fires once) and `balance_exhausted` + the meter stopping
  the audio session while leaving the connection up.

## 7. Preferences and the usage counter

Existing user-scoped preferences (columns on `users`):

| Preference            | Endpoint                                  | Column                                        |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Preferred language    | `POST /api/user/language`                 | `users.language` (migration 045)              |
| TTS engine + voice    | `POST /api/user/tts-prefs`                | `users.tts_engine_pref`, `users.tts_voice_id` |
| Locale                | set at login                              | `users.locale` (migration 026)                |
| Cartesia cloned voice | `POST /api/sessions/enhanced/clone-voice` | `users.cartesia_voice_id`                     |

**Not present**: subtitle preferences, translated-audio toggle, original-audio volume, subtitle font
size/position, dual-language mode, default tier/engine, and — importantly — **any usage-counter
reset baseline**. `POST /api/extension/usage-counter/reset` has no existing counterpart; it needs a
column + migration, or it lives in `chrome.storage` and is device-local.

Migrations: 51 files, `server/migrations/001..051`. Project rule (CLAUDE.md) is that they must be
idempotent and that an already-applied migration must **never** be edited (`sqlx::migrate!` checksums them).

---

## 8. Reusable HTTP surface

Directly usable by the extension with no backend change:

| Endpoint                     | Gives                                                                          |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `GET /api/auth/config`       | Google client id; billing-enabled probe                                        |
| `POST /api/auth/google`      | login → JWT + profile                                                          |
| `GET /api/user/me`           | id, email, name, avatar, **balance**, consent, tts prefs, language             |
| `GET /api/engines`           | all tiers with `rate_per_minute`, per-tier language lists, capabilities, flags |
| `GET /api/billing/packages`  | purchasable credit packages                                                    |
| `POST /api/billing/checkout` | Stripe checkout session                                                        |
| `GET /api/billing/history`   | ledger                                                                         |
| `GET /api/usage/sessions`    | past usage sessions                                                            |
| `POST /api/user/language`    | persist target language                                                        |

Auth middleware is `middleware.rs` `AuthUser` (Bearer JWT). CORS is an explicit allow-list of app
origins with `allow_credentials(true)` (`lib.rs:540-565`) — **a `chrome-extension://` origin is not
currently allowed**, which is a real, small backend change needed for any XHR from the extension.

Base URLs come from config, not hard-coding: `APP_BASE_URL` (default `https://voxtranslate.app`),
`DASHBOARD_BASE_URL` (`config.rs:1091-1100`).

## 9. Required backend changes (minimum viable, ranked by risk)

| #   | Change                                                                                     | Risk          | Why needed                                          |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Allow `chrome-extension://<id>` in CORS allow-list                                         | low           | any `fetch` from the side panel                     |
| 2   | Extension session mode on `/ws` (source/target split, single peer) + a `MeterScope` for it | **high**      | §6 blocker; nothing else makes the product work     |
| 3   | Extension preferences (subtitles, volume, font, position, default engine)                  | medium        | needs columns + migration, or keep device-local     |
| 4   | Usage-counter reset baseline                                                               | medium        | needs a column + migration                          |
| 5   | OAuth AS: `/authorize`, code+PKCE exchange, refresh rotation, revocation                   | **very high** | only if we refuse to reuse the existing JWT handoff |

Every one of these is unverifiable locally (§1.1).

---

## 10. Risks and unknowns

1. **Backend cannot be compiled or tested on this machine.** Rust changes go in blind, CI-only.
   Verified, not speculative.
2. **The room model does not fit the product.** §6. No amount of extension-side cleverness avoids
   a backend decision here.
3. **The brief's commercial model does not exist.** Credits, EUR, plans, allowed tiers, default tier
   (§3). Implementing it as specified means building a consumer plan/credits system — far beyond a
   Chrome extension, and in direct tension with the brief's own "never create a second ledger" rule.
4. **No OAuth authorization server** (§2). PKCE-with-VoxTranslate is a from-scratch AS, not a wiring job.
5. **Enhanced tier is client-direct.** Supporting it in the extension means a second in-browser
   pipeline (Cartesia STT+TTS) plus the translate-hop, inside an MV3 offscreen document.
6. **`<all_urls>`-shaped tension.** Subtitles over "any website" needs broad content-script injection.
   The brief asks to avoid `<all_urls>`. `activeTab` + `scripting.executeScript` on user gesture is
   the narrow path, but it must be validated against fullscreen and SPA navigation.
7. **Chrome API behaviour must be checked against current docs** before committing — in particular
   `chrome.tabCapture` in MV3 (the `getMediaStreamId` + offscreen consumer pattern), and whether the
   captured stream still plays through to the user by default (it does not; audio must be re-routed
   or the tab goes silent).
8. **Not verifiable by me**: tab capture, real subtitle rendering on YouTube, translated-audio
   latency, repeated start/stop cleanup. These need a human with Chrome, a logged-in account and a
   funded balance.

---

## 11. Summary judgement

The extension's **client half** is well-supported: the audio format, subtitle events, translated-audio
frames, language-detection events, balance events, engine catalogue, and language catalogue all exist
and are reusable almost verbatim.

The **backend half** is where the brief and reality diverge, on three independent axes — session
shape (§6), commercial model (§3), and auth (§2). None of those is a coding detail; each is a product
decision with a materially different cost. They are put to the user in the implementation plan rather
than resolved silently.
